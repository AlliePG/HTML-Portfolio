<h1>The best Disney Movies According to Alice</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Disney movies ever</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Hercules</h3>
<p>Definetely the best Disney cartoon ever. From the story to the songs, there's nothing disappointing about this cartoon.</p>
<h3>2. Raya</h3>
<p>Loved the story, the animations and the combat. Such great combat animations were totally unexpected. Amazing</p>
<h3>3. Moana</h3>
<p>Moana's songs are just the best songs Disnay has ever created.</p>
