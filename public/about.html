<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Alice Paganotto, a young (almost 30, I'm still young yeah and I'll always feel young) Italian woman. 
  I was born and raised in northern Italy, moved south for love and now thinking about moving abroad</p>

<p>I studied finance and languages at high school, languages at university. 
  I can fluently speak English, and have a basic knowledge of German, French and Spanish. I used to know them better but well, they need practice.
  I've worked a lot of different jobs, but in all of them I felt like I was missing something. And now I know what is it: it's the creativity.
  Right now I'm an IT consultant. I really like the IT world, but what I really want to make with the IT is to create, to make things better.</p>

<p>While I navigate the internet, I often think about what I could make better. What could be prettier (And colorful. I love colors. all of them.),
  what could be more helpful, what could be more user-friendly. 
  I really believe the web development can properly mix my will to be more creative and to be more useful.</p>

<p>Let's give you some more non-important info to know me better. I'm somehow a nerd. I love gaming, I love anime and manga.<br />
  I so damn love Star Wars (I'm a sith btw. Siths are cooler and red is the best color for a lightsaber).<br />
  I love roleplay games.<br />
  I love many things.</p>
